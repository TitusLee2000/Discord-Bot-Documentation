# Overview of Discord Bot Documentation
----

Welcome to [Discord Bot Documentation](https://tituslee2000.github.io/Discord-Bot-Documentation/) 

The goal of this documentation is to provide you with enough information to build your first Discord Bot. 

This documentation is a collaborative effort by [Timothy Kim](https://github.com/Timothykim21) and [Titus Lee](https://github.com/TitusLee2000/)

## How We Created Our Guide
----
Our guide was created using our knowledge of Python to apply key concepts to a Discord bot backend. Throughout the process, we reflected on the challenges we encountered while working with Python, developing a Discord bot, and collaborating on a group project. Our goal was to ensure that our instructions were clear, thorough, and concise, making it easier for others to follow along. We also focused on best practices, troubleshooting common issues.


### MKDocs

We used the MKDocs framework to create a website that serves as a display for our documentation. To enhance readability and flexibility, we implemented the Material theme, which provided a clean, modern design and useful features such as responsive layouts, built-in search functionality, and improved navigation. This combination made it easier to present our content in a structured and visually appealing manner

### Using Markdown

This was our first time using Markdown for an entire project. Overall, it was easy to navigate and made formatting straightforward, but we did encounter some frustrations while writing the documentation. Certain aspects, such as handling tables and complex formatting, required extra effort. Despite these challenges, the experience was valuable, and we gained a better understanding of Markdown’s capabilities.

### Using VSCode

Both team members utilized VSCode to author our Markdown documentation files. We ran `mkdocs serve` in the terminal to preview the website in real-time, leveraging the Material for MkDocs theme to visualize the final design.

### A Style Guide

We standardized the styling format throughout the entire documentation to enhance readability and ensure a consistent experience.

Code blocks were utilized to showcase code examples in the preferred format, allowing users to easily view and copy the code for their own use.

Additionally, we incorporated annotations—such as information tabs, warning tabs, and success indicators—to highlight tips, potential issues, or key details, guiding users effectively through problems, advice, or successful outcomes.

## Conclusion

Creating our guide was a valuable learning experience that allowed us to refine our technical writing skills while working collaboratively on a real-world project. By leveraging MKDocs, Markdown, and VSCode, we were able to build a well-structured and visually appealing documentation site. Standardizing our style and incorporating annotations helped improve clarity and usability, making our guide more accessible to users. Despite some challenges along the way, the process strengthened our understanding of Python, Discord bot development, and effective documentation practices. We hope this guide serves as a helpful resource for others embarking on similar projects.
